                <p><strong>IsItHealthy</strong> allows users to submit images or descriptions of food items,
                    particularly non-packaged foods. The App utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) services (including
                    Google Gemini), is based on general principles, and uses our own algorithms to provide an
                    <strong>estimated informational score (0-100)</strong> and related guidance regarding the potential
                    healthfulness of the food item.</p>
                <p>This score is generated based on algorithms informed by publicly available principles from recognized
                    health organizations and frameworks, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the NOVA food
                    classification system, and balanced diet models like the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate.</p>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> The score and any analysis provided are intended for general
                    informational and educational purposes only. Due to significant variations in non-packaged food
                    ingredients, preparation, and portion sizes, the score is an estimate, not a precise nutritional
                    measurement. Images processed by AI are handled as described in our <a
                        href="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="health-disclaimer">3. IMPORTANT Health Disclaimer and Nature of Information</h2>

                <p><strong>Not Medical or Nutritional Advice:</strong><br>This application ("App") and the informational
                    scores, assessments, and any related content it provides are estimations and are intended for
                    general informational and educational purposes ONLY. While the principles guiding these estimations
                    are based on recognized international health guidelines and frameworks (see <a
                        href="#sources-approach">'Sources Informing Our Approach'</a> below), this information is not a
                    substitute for professional medical or nutritional advice.</p>

                <p><strong>Consult Professionals:</strong><br>You MUST consult with a qualified doctor, registered
                    dietitian, or other appropriate healthcare professional regarding any health concerns, conditions,
                    or questions you may have, and before making any decisions or changes related to your health or
                    diet, including changes based on information from this App. Do not disregard professional medical
                    advice or delay seeking it because of information obtained from this App. Relying solely on the
                    score or information from this App for health decisions is strongly discouraged. Your use of this
                    App does not establish a doctor-patient, dietitian-client, or any other professional-client
                    relationship between you and IsItHealthy.</p>

                <p><strong>Estimation, Basis, and Accuracy Limitations:</strong><br>The scores themselves are generated
                    using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for recognition of food images/descriptions and rely on our
                    proprietary algorithms based on general healthy food principles (see <a
                        href="#sources-approach">'Sources Informing Our Approach'</a> below). Actual nutritional
                    content, ingredients, portion sizes, preparation methods, and the resulting health impact of any
                    specific food item you consume can vary SIGNIFICANTLY from these estimates. Factors such as
                    freshness, specific recipes, cooking oils used, and individual metabolic responses are not accounted
                    for. Due to these limitations inherent in food data, AI recognition, and the variability of food
                    items (especially non-packaged foods), the accuracy of the score or any information provided by this
                    App cannot be, and is not, guaranteed.</p>

                <p><strong>Assumption of Risk:</strong><br>You acknowledge and agree that you use this App and interpret
                    its score and information entirely at your own risk. You assume ALL risk associated with using the
                    information provided by this App, including any decisions made based on its content. IsItHealthy
                    disclaims any and all liability for errors, omissions, or interpretations of the information
                    provided.</p>

                    related to the App or these Terms. Most user concerns can be resolved quickly and informally. If
                    informal resolution is unsuccessful, you agree that any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out
                    of or related to these Terms or the App shall be instituted exclusively in the federal or state
                    courts located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, although we retain the right to bring any
                    suit, action or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms in your country of residence or any
                    other relevant country.</p>
